// Delete this when merging/compiling - Kevin

//This is the general layout of the combat phase. 
//All the characters will be standing in one position and each unit will take turns to perform an action. 
//If it's the player's turn, the player can tap on an enemy to lock on to it and a UI will appear to display the enemy's stats. 
//If the player chooses to attack, then the player will have to swipe the basic attack button up (like playing a card).


// Add a function, if you drag the item in the slot then you add the health
// Add a health and damage variable in the player and enemy 
// Then add attack function
//Combine yours and Xiong's together, then add a battle manager to decide whose turn it is and that should be all for the battle phase
